   <div>Navigation
    A common pattern for navigation is to have a list of items displayed as a horizontal bar. This pattern, as basic as it seems, was difficult to achieve before flexbox. It forms the most simple of flexbox examples, and could be considered the ideal flexbox use case.
    
    When we have a set of items that we want to display horizontally, we may well end up with additional space. We need to decide what to do with that space, and have a couple of options. We either display the space outside of the items — therefore spacing them out with white space between or around them — or we absorb the extra space inside the items and therefore need a method of allowing the items to grow and take up this space.</div>

    <p>Holle In this guide, we will take a look at some of the common use cases for flexbox — those places where it makes more sense than another layout method.</p>

    <p>In reality we also often use Flexbox for jobs that might be better done by Grid Layout, as a fallback for Grid, and also in order to get alignment capabilities. This is something that may well change once Box Alignment is implemented in Block Layout. In this guide we'll look at some of the typical things you might use flexbox for today.</p>
